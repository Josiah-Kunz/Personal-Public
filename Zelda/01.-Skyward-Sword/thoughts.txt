Hardware: Wii 25th anniversary dual-disc edition on a Wii U

Review:

 - The fights were too easy and underwhelming. No preparation or thought really required.
 - The games really were fun. I think the falling ring clown game was the most fun,
	or the pumpkin toss one.
 - The silent realm stuff wasn't that fun until it was timed. Then it was way more fun.
 - Everyone complains about the fetch quests, but they weren't too bad. I just wish the 
	quests had more story like in Majora's Mask. The personal plots lead nowhere! Like
	that one dude's mom who paid me to clean her house. Explore their relationship.
 - Item upgrades were fun. It didn't feel like I was playing with gimped items which
	had to be upgraded in order to be fun.
	
Conspiracy theories:

 - Groose is the ancestor of Gannondorf and all of the Gerudos
	- Takes an interest in Impa in both forms (young and old)
	- If you match Groose's hair with Impa's skin you sort of get a Gerudo
	- Lots of "triforce imagery" between Zelda, Link, and Groose 
	- Triforce of power was never explicity stated (make sure this is true!)
 - In OoT, Twinrova gets a halo. They didn't go to heaven; Demise gets the same halo effect in the third sealing fight!
	- This would imply Twinrova didn't die, but rose through a hole in the ceiling.
	- It makes sense they would show up in Majora's Mask.
 - Your red loftwing reincarnates as Epona (I think this is obvious and actually intended by the devs, but look it up!).
 - Other incarnations: Zelda's father as OoT Sage of Light; Pipit as Mido; Beetle as Beetle in Windwaker; I'm sure there are more.
 - The big octopus (Tantalus) only attacks when you're going after Nauru's Flame. It doesn't attack in the timeline otherwise. Did it control the robot pirate and its crew? Fi says there's an "evil presence", so we can't assume it was just protecting Nauru's Flame from anyone.
 - Fi disobeys your command at least once: when you're trying to get the water basin from Faron to quench the frog at the entrance of the Fire Temple, Fi says you need the robot that hauls things. When you select "No, not that guy...", Fi disobeys and calls him anyway, saying you're being too picky.
