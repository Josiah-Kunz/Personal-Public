\graphic{filename=Preliminary/hardware, caption={Hardware. \textbf{Left}: cartridge bought from zelda-shop.com for \$30. \textbf{Middle}: Gameboy Advance bought from Press~Start in Jacksonville, IL for \$50. No backlit screen since I really wanted it to be on original hardware. On the other hand, I never owned a GBA, so I guess I could've done whatever I wanted. \textbf{Right}: GBA case the guy at Press~Start threw in for \$2. I'm pretty sure it was supposed to be marketed towards girls, but hey, a case is a case. \textbf{Total}: \$82 (out of the \$100 I got from Dad for my 34th birthday).}}
