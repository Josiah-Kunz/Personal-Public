 - The fights were too easy and underwhelming. No preparation or thought really required.
 - The games really were fun. I think the falling ring clown game was the most fun,
	or the pumpkin toss one.
 - The silent realm stuff wasn't that fun until it was timed. Then it was way more fun.
 - Everyone complains about the fetch quests, but they weren't too bad. I just wish the 
	quests had more story like in Majora's Mask. The personal plots lead nowhere! Like
	that one dude's mom who paid me to clean her house. Explore their relationship.
 - Item upgrades were fun. It didn't feel like I was playing with gimped items which
	had to be upgraded in order to be fun.
